# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), an 
advent calender of small programming puzzles. 

I used python 3.10 and developed the notebooks in VS code.
Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to recreate the environment, 
although only the standard library was used (and ipykernel for the notebooks).
